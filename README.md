This game is played by two players.

There are a total of 6 tiles, 4 of which are 1x1 cells and two that are 2x1 cells.

Tiles are double-sided. Every tile has two sides: one side has a “dot” and the other side has a “plus”.

Both players are assigned to a symbol (plus or dot). One 2x1 tile and two 1x1 tiles are given to each player. The players then flip their tiles so that the symbol on the sides facing upwards matches the assigned symbol.

On one’s turn, one may place down a tile if they have any at hand.

On one’s turn, one may use one of their tiles on the board to push another tile on the board. Both types of tiles have the ability to push other tiles on the board. When a tile pushes another tile, this motion is parallel to one of the board’s edges.
If a tile is pushed off the board, it is flipped to reveal the symbol on the other side. It is then given to the person who has the corresponding symbol.

Large 2x1 tiles may not move unless they are pushing another tile. 1x1 tiles may move freely.

Tiles are not allowed to push a “stack” of more than 1 tile. However, large 2x1 pieces can move two pieces at once if they do not “stack”.

Large 2x1 tiles are not allowed to be pushed in a way that causes half of the 2x1 tile to be off the board and half of the 2x1 tile to be on the board.

Tiles can only push by one cell per turn.

Players may perform these actions: move a 1x1 tile freely (if on board), use a 2x1 tile to push another tile (if on board), use a 1x1 tile to push another tile (if on board), or place down a tile (if there are tiles in hand).

To win, one must make it impossible for the opponent to perform an action according to the rules. This is most commonly done by taking all of the tiles.

If a tile A pushes another tile B, B may not push tile A back in the same direction the next turn. You are not allowed to move a singular tile back and forth repeatedly every time it is your turn. These statements disallow "pushbacks".
